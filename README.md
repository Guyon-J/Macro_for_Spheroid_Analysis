# An analysis tool for Cancer Spheroids 

This tool will propose several processes for the automatic analysis of spheroids.
Have a look at the project's [JOVE](https://www.jove.com/v/60998/a-3d-spheroid-model-for-glioblastoma) to get more information about the image analysis tools.
While the code is the same, it is a more ergonomic version of the previous published one because parameters can be easily changed in dialog boxes (left click).


## Installation instructions
In [Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) window, open Plugins > Macros > Startup Macros... and copy and past the >> __[code](https://github.com/Guyon-J/Macro_for_Spheroid_Analysis/blob/main/Macro_Spheroid_v2.ijm)__ <<. 
Change the language into IJ1 Macro and save as .ijm file in the Fiji.app folder > macros > toolsets.

Select the tool in the "More Tools" menu (**>>**)


## Tool icons
1. Global Area <br> <img align='left' src="https://github.com/Guyon-J/Macro_for_Spheroid_Analysis/blob/main/Images/SPH.png" height='40'/> Allows simultaneous analysis of multiple spheroid images. It is possible to choose the area to quantify in the dialogs box. Combination of the two following tool. <br><br><hr>
2. Total area <br> <img align='left' src="https://github.com/Guyon-J/Macro_for_Spheroid_Analysis/blob/main/Images/TOTAL.png" height='40'/> Analysis of the total area of one image of spheroid. <br><br><hr>

## Compatibility

This toolset was developed on window 10, and tested using ImageJ v1.53. Many features require installation of command line tools that may present future challenges on different operating systems.
